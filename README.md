**Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to design andimplement a real-time image processing application using Apache Storm. Theapplication aims to showcase distributed computing principles by processingvideo frames in parallel, applying various image filters, and aggregating theresults. The project emphasizes the utilization of Apache Storm, a powerful andscalable distributed stream processing framework, to achieve efficient andreal-time image processing.

**Key Features and Objectives:**

2.  **Real-time Stream Processing:** Implement a streaming data processing pipeline that operates in real-time, demonstrating the capabilities of Apache Storm for handling continuous streams of data.

3.  **Parallel Image Processing:** Utilize distributed computing principles to process video frames in parallel. This involves breaking down the image processing tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed concurrently on multiple nodes.

4.  **Image Filtering:** Apply image filters to enhance or modify the visual characteristics of each frame. Image processing libraries, such as OpenCV for Java, will be employed to implement various filters, such as Gaussian blur, sharpening, and grayscale conversion.

5.  **Aggregation of Results:** Aggregate the processed frames to produce meaningful insights or visual effects. For example, combining frames processed with different filters to generate a composite image.

**Framework and Tools:**

- **Primary Framework:** Apache Storm will serve as the primary framework for building the distributed stream processing application. Apache Storm excels in handling real-time data streams and provides fault tolerance and scalability.

- **Programming Language:** The project will be implemented in Java, although other suitable languages may be considered. Java is chosen for its compatibility with Apache Storm and the availability of libraries like OpenCV.

- **Image Processing Libraries:** OpenCV for Java (OpenCV-Java) will be used as the primary image processing library. OpenCV provides a wide range of functionalities for image and video processing, making it a suitable choice for implementing diverse image filters.

**Expected Outcome:** The successful completion of this project willresult in a robust, real-time image processing application built on ApacheStorm. The application will showcase the distributed computing capabilities ofApache Storm while demonstrating advanced image processing techniques. Theoutcomes may include visually enhanced video streams, performance metricsrelated to parallel processing, and insights into the efficiency of real-timestream processing with Apache Storm.

**Importance:** This project is significant as it combines theprinciples of distributed computing and real-time stream processing to addresschallenges related to continuous data streams, such as those encountered in videoprocessing. The application serves as a practical example of leveraging ApacheStorm for distributed computing tasks, demonstrating its potential in handlinglarge-scale, real-time data processing applications.

**Main Concepts in Apache Storm:**

**1\. Topology:**

- A Storm topology is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of spouts and bolts, defining the data flow in the system.

- Spouts are the sources of data, often responsible for reading from external streams or queues.

- Bolts are the processing units that receive and process the data emitted by spouts or other bolts.

**2\. Spouts:**

- Spouts are the entry points for data into a Storm topology.

- They are responsible for fetching and emitting streams of data for further processing.

- Spouts can read data from various sources, such as Kafka, Twitter, or any other streaming platform.

**3\. Bolts:**

- Bolts process and transform the data received from spouts or other bolts.

- They perform specific operations on the data, such as filtering, aggregation, or enrichment.

- Bolts emit new streams, allowing for the creation of complex processing pipelines.

**4\. Tuple:**

- A tuple is the fundamental unit of data in Storm.

- It is an ordered set of values, similar to a row in a database or a JSON object.

- Tuples are passed between spouts and bolts within the topology.

**5\. Stream:**

- A stream is an unbounded sequence of tuples in Storm.

- It represents a continuous flow of data that can be processed by the topology.

- Streams are the channels through which data is communicated between spouts and bolts.

**6\. Nimbus:**

- Nimbus is the master node in a Storm cluster responsible for distributing code and coordinating the execution of topologies.

- It accepts the topologies submitted by users and assigns tasks to Supervisor nodes.

**7\. Supervisor:**

- Supervisors are worker nodes responsible for executing tasks assigned by Nimbus.

- They run spouts and bolts as separate processes in a distributed environment.

**8\. Task:**

- A task is the smallest unit of parallelism in Storm.

- Each spout or bolt can have multiple tasks running in parallel across the cluster.

- Tasks process different subsets of the data, enabling parallel and scalable processing.

**9\. Storm UI:**

- The Storm UI provides a web-based interface to monitor and manage Storm clusters.

- It offers insights into the status and performance of running topologies, including metrics and logs.

**10\. Acknowledgment and Failures:**

- Storm ensures reliability through tuple acknowledgment and replay mechanisms.

- Bolts can acknowledge the successful processing of tuples, and failed tuples are replayed to maintain data integrity.

Apache Storm's main concepts enable the creation of fault-tolerant,scalable, and real-time data processing systems. By understanding thesecomponents, developers can design and implement distributed processingtopologies tailored to their specific use cases.

**System Mode: Distributed Image Filtering with Apache Storm**

In the proposed system architecture, the main objective is to leveragethe distributed processing capabilities of Apache Storm for real-time imagefiltering. The system is designed to handle video streams and apply twodistinct types of image processing elements (PEs): PE1, responsible forapplying a Gaussian blur filter, and PE2, which applies a sharpening filter toeach frame of the video.

**1\. Distributed Processing:**

- Apache Storm is employed as the primary framework for distributed processing.

- The system is designed to operate in a distributed environment, utilizing multiple nodes to process video frames in parallel.

**2\. Processing Elements (PEs):**

- **PE1 (Gaussian Blur):**

- **PE2 (Sharpening):**

**3\. Frame Aggregation:**

- Develops a Processing Element (PE3) responsible for combining the output of PE1 and PE2.

- PE3 sums up the matrices resulting from the applied filters, creating a composite frame that incorporates both the Gaussian blur and sharpening effects.

**4\. Output Creation:**

- A Processing Element (PE4) is implemented to generate a new video file with the filtered frames.

- PE4 utilizes Apache Storm's capabilities to process the combined frames and produce an output video file with the desired visual effects.

**5\. Frame Analysis:**

- The system includes mechanisms to analyze each frame and collect relevant information.

- A text file is generated containing frame analysis data, including metrics such as average brightness and frame count.

- The frame analysis data provides insights into the visual characteristics of the processed video.

**6\. Real-Time Processing:**

- The entire system operates in real-time, enabling the application of image filters to video frames as they are received.

- Apache Storm's parallel processing model ensures efficient and scalable handling of video streams.

By adopting Apache Storm and dividing theimage processing tasks into distributed and parallelized elements, the systemachieves a balance between performance and scalability. The modular designallows for seamless integration of additional processing elements and theincorporation of diverse image filtering techniques.
